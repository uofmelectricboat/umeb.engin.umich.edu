## Previewing the Website

Below are the steps to viewing this website locally:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. From the terminal, direct to the folder you would like to copy this project into. For example, if you want it in an existing folder on your Desktop named "boat", run the command ```cd Desktop/boat```.

3. Run the command:
   - ```git clone https://github.com/uofmelectricboat/umeb.engin.umich.edu.git``` (to use your personal access token)
   - OR ```git clone git@github.com:uofmelectricboat/umeb.engin.umich.edu.git``` (to use your SSH key)

4. If neither of the above commands work, that means you have yet to set up a personal access token or SSH on your device. Follow:
   - [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to create a personal access token (recommended for single use)
   - OR [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent to set up an SSH key (recommended for long-term use)

5. Open a new window of VS Code. Open the "umeb.engin.umich.edu/umeb/" folder.

6. Go to the "Extensions" tab on the left sidebar of VS Code. If you can't find it, navigate to "View > Extensions" from the top menu.
