            <p>Our three sub teams work together in order to lead UMEB to victory! Each team works throughout the year to prepare for our summer competition - the Promoting Electronic Propulsion Competition. We rely on communication across all three teams in order to reach our goals! We operate with the DEI initiative that states that diversity is paramount to UMEB's success. We are building the next generation of leaders in the field of engineering. Everyone is welcome to our team regardless of background, experience, or area of expertise. There is a place for everyone at UMEB!</p>
